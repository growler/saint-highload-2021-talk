Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-09-16 21:31:41.
Progress(19) at 2021-09-16 21:31:42: 4,927 states generated, 2,869 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 2869 total distinct states at (2021-09-16 21:31:42)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2021-09-16 21:31:42
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.2E-13
4927 states generated, 2869 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 19.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 4 and the 95th percentile is 3).
