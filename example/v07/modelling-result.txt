Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 2 branches.
Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-09-15 20:53:05.
Progress(29) at 2021-09-15 20:53:06: 29,490 states generated, 15,435 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 2 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 30870 total distinct states at (2021-09-15 20:53:06)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2021-09-15 20:53:06
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.2E-11
29490 states generated, 15435 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 29.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 5 and the 95th percentile is 2).
