Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 2 branches.
Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-09-16 21:31:46.
Progress(21) at 2021-09-16 21:31:47: 7,357 states generated, 4,129 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 2 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 8258 total distinct states at (2021-09-16 21:31:47)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2021-09-16 21:31:47
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 7.2E-13
7357 states generated, 4129 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 21.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 4 and the 95th percentile is 2).
